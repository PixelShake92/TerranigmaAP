This is the start of a Terranigma randomizer with the end goal of implementing it into Archipelago. 

To build locally on your system simply download all of the files and follow the folder structure. Then run in your command console or Visual Studio Code etc python build.py
it should build a dist and builds folder. inside the dists you will see 3 files. terranigma-randomizer-gui.exe is the main program. it uses the .exe to open through the command console and patch based on the settings. 

This is currently a solo project but I will more than welcome more eyes and developers if they are keen beans!
